# History:
## Beginning
During the first two years of the club’s existence (2008-2010), the team had no real experience and very few sponsors. In 2011 the team started with a new mentor, new students and an unheated workspace at the mentor’s residence. There was a lot of confusion, chaos, and unorganized build meetings. Somehow, with limited funding and long nights of hard work in a cold garage, the team was able to pull through and shipped an unfinished and untested robot to the regional competition.

## 2012 and 2013
After the 2011 competition, many of the team 2976’s members graduated, and the team was left to a very small pool of inexperienced members. New mentors and ideas were introduced. More emphasis was placed on the students developing the strategy and the design. A mentor lectured on design and construction techniques to aid students in the competition and the team created a prototype robot. Parents, mentors, and the students came together to lay a better, long lasting foundation for the club. This led to the procurement of two rooms at our school, large power tools in one of the rooms, creation of a business plan, and plans to create better awareness within the school and community. We received funding from three grants and sponsors. Our 2012 robot was riddled with defects and did not advance to the qualification rounds of regionals. Our 2013 Frisbee robot was also plagued with issues and indecision from our team. Even so, we learned from our failures.

## 2014
Our 2014 robot was well-designed with a lot of teamwork, communication, and dedication. Although it failed initially as we headed into our first district event, we continued to improve it, advancing to finals in the new Glacier Peak District. At our second district event we would captain an alliance for the second time in our team's history. After two successful competitions we would move on to the Pacific Northwest District Championships in Portland.

## 2015
This year we moved trash around a field. We had another successful year building a robot that would make it to the elimination stage two times. This time unfortunately we were unable to advance past the Quarterfinals both times, and thus did not qualify for District Championships.   

## 2016
We were District Event Winners at the Glacier Peak event.
This was the first year we used a scouting system. The Android app we created is called ScoutBot.

## 2017
This is the first year we made binders for an award. At the Glacier Peak District Event, our outreach efforts were recognized and we won the Engineering Inspiration award. Through the EI award, we competed for the DCMP award at the Pacific Northwest District Championships. Our robot was one of the best we had ever built, and we almost qualified for DCMP.
We also updated our Android scouting app for the Steamworks competition.
