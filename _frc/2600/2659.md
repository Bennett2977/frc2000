The RoboWarriors is a robotics team at Bishop Alemany High School in Mission Hills, California. Since 2008, our rookie year, we have had the opportunity to compete in FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) with other schools and robotic's teams. Over the years, our goal has been to spread the message of FIRST and STEM which is to inspire and help students learn more about Science and Technology.
